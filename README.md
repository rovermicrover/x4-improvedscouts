# About

Scouts serve no purpose beyond being a starting ship. They are out classed in every way except for the Pegasus because of its speed. This mod aims to fix that by giving all scouts a 50% boot to their radar range. Hopefully making them a useful part of any fleet. Works with both expansions.

# Compatibility

Works with These Other Mods That Adds Scouts. They are listed as optional dependencies for compatibility.
